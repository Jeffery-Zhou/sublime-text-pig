Info
----

Work in progress.  Supports syntax highlighting and command completion for most Pig functions and keywords.
Build will run the script under "pig -x local".

Issues
------

- PigLatin.sublime-build needs to be modified per system (I need to figure out global env vars in ST2).
- Error line highlighting not working.
- Currently some minor keywords and functions.

Install
-------

1) Copy the 'Pig' folder to your user packages folder.  In OS X it's: ~/Libary/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User
2) Edit "PigLatin.sublime-build" to match your system config.
