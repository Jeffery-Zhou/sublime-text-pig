Work in progress.  Supports syntax highlighting and command completion for most Pig functions and keywords.
Build will run the script under 'pig -x local'.

Issues
------

- PigLatin.sublime-build needs to be modified per system (I need to figure out global env vars in ST2).
- Error line highlighting not working.
- Currently some minor keywords and functions.

Syntax highlighting based on Tommy Chheng's TextMate Bundle: http://tommy.chheng.com/2009/09/14/pig-textmate-bundle/
